    "Besides my career of being a web developer, I am also a father, and I really enjoy spending time with my daughter, Marcella, and my wife, Maddie. There's also some time in there for romping around with my two large dogs, Banjo and Harley.",
    "When not spending time with my family, I love playing tabletop games and D&D with friends. This hobby kind of bled into my other interests in 3D printing where I seem to print far more miniatures than I can possibly paint.",
    "Apart from being a father and super nerd I am also an avid runner. Last year after training for 16 weeks, I ran my first full marathon for the Seattle Rock n Roll marathon in 2019 and plan on running it again someday!"
